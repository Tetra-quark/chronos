# Chronos: a high precision timing calculator. 

Simple module implementing a high precision (millisecond) timing calculator to assist in verifying and correcting times when confusion or interruptions occur at show-jumping competitions. Far from perfect, lots of room for improvement but does the job.

It is recommended to use the GUI rather than the chronos module directly, just run `python chronos_gui.py` in a terminal. 

Dependencies:
- tkinter (GUI)
- timedelta
