## Chronos a high precision time calculator. 

Simple module implementing a high precision (millisecond) timing calculator to assist in verifying and correcting times when confusion or interruptions occur at show-jumping competitions. 

Although it can be used from inside a terminal the GUI makes the tool easier to use and is recommended.
